# IEF 


## Instructions (EDIT): 

Define a config file in ```ief_core/configs```. A test one has been provided. 

Then, run: ```python launch_run.py --config [NAME OF CONFIG FILE]```

Note that the folder containing the MMRF processing scripts (```data/ml_mmrf```) can be cloned from the clinicalML github. To run the tests, first install pytest and then run ```py.test``` in ```ief_core/tests```.
